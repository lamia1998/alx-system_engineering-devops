Issue Summary:

On March 4th, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, the web service encountered an outage, impacting 75% of our user base. This outage led to a complete disruption of service, attributed to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The misconfiguration caused an overload of backend servers.

Timezone: 
10:00 AM: Monitoring alerts detect a surge in server response times.
10:10 AM: Engineers initiate investigation of system logs to determine the cause.
11:03 AM: Incident escalation to the infrastructure team for additional support.
12:00 PM: Root cause identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
12:50 PM: Load balancer configuration rectified, and affected servers restarted to restore service.


Root Cause:
The outage stemmed from a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven traffic distribution and subsequently resulting in server overload.

Resolution and Recovery:
To resolve the issue, the load balancer configuration was corrected at 12:00 PM. Subsequently, affected servers were restarted at 12:50 PM to restore normal functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Organize regular training sessions for engineering teams to ensure proficiency in load balancer management best practices.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into server performance and traffic distribution, enabling proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues.
Better things next time : 
To enhance our response, we can refine our escalation procedures to ensure faster involvement of relevant teams, thereby minimizing downtime. Additionally, we should prioritize more rigorous testing procedures for load balancer configurations before deploying them to production environments.
